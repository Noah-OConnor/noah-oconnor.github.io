With a limited HUD to guide you, every dodge, strike, and ability must be earned through mastery of the blade.",Dev Tools,"Unreal Engine 5, C++, Blueprints",LinkedIn,https://www.linkedin.com/company/squinky-studios/,"Rebuilt Souls-like combat from scratch in UE5.5 using GAS, montages, and input buffering focusing on heavy weapon feel",Combat Design,"I designed the core pacing and feel of Crimson Knight's single boss encounter, drawing inspiration from Dark Souls and Sekiro. My focus was on player clarity and satisfying, weighty exchanges between the Knight and The Absolute. I designed and tuned movesets, cancel windows, and player openings to reward timing and precision, while prototyping mechanics like time-stop reactions and stagger thresholds to increase skill expression.","I designed the core pacing and feel of Crimson Knight's single boss encounter, drawing inspiration from Dark Souls and Sekiro.

,/media/CrimsonKnightScreenshot1.jpg,image,/media/CrimsonKnightScreenshot1.jpg,The Absolute standing in front of her throne,,,,Team Tools,"Perforce, Jira, Confluence",,,Solved roll and sprint animation cancel bugs by reworking root motion and force-based movement logic,Gameplay Ability System - GAS,"I integrated Unreal's Gameplay Ability System to drive all combat, movement, and utility abilities in the project. This included custom attribute sets, ability cooldown logic, gameplay tags for state handling, and effects like healing, stuns, and projectile slashes. I converted major gameplay systems including dodge, sprint, and even jumping into modular GAS abilities to support extensibility and future designer control.","I integrated Unreal's Gameplay Ability System to drive all combat, movement, and utility abilities in the project.

,,,,,,,,Genre,Souls-like,,,Prototyped slow-motion and VFX-based telegraphs to communicate boss attacks through timing and spectacle,Character Movement,"I rebuilt the Knight's entire movement and animation framework using UE5.5's Enhanced Input and a custom Animation Blueprint derived from ABP_Manny. Movement includes root motion dodges, iFrameless sidesteps, direction-sensitive sprinting, and full support for animation canceling. I also resolved critical bugs like stair traversal, input blending, and camera responsiveness during lock-on.","I rebuilt the Knight's entire movement and animation framework using UE5.5's Enhanced Input and a custom Animation Blueprint derived from ABP_Manny.

,,,,,,,,Team Size,18 Core Developers + 6 Contractors,,,Built and refined a modular ability system enabling me to create 10+ player abilities,Gameplay & Feel Tuning,"My role extended into fine-tuning every interaction between player inputs and gameplay feedback. I adjusted roll windows, sprint cancel timing, and weapon hit lag to ensure the Knight felt deliberate yet responsive. To support our no-HUD constraint, I replaced traditional UI elements (like charge bars) with responsive Niagara VFX that reflect player state in real-time.","My role extended into fine-tuning every interaction between player inputs and gameplay feedback.

,,,,,,,,Time Frame,Jan - Aug 2025,,,"Iterated on mechanics like weapon charge to satisfy a no-HUD constraint, replacing bars with reactive VFX feedback",Design Documentation,"Early in development, I created the foundational design materials for the Knight's combat system including combat flowcharts, ability boards, and mechanic reference breakdowns using Miro. These helped align the design, art, and programming teams during prototyping and set clear direction for building our Souls-like mechanics.","Early in development, I created the foundational design materials for the Knight's combat system including combat flowcharts, ability boards, and mechanic reference breakdowns using Miro.

,,,,,,,,Primary Role,Technical Designer,,,,Development Support,"Throughout the project, I worked cross-discipline to support other departments: building level specific mechanics, troubleshooting Data Layer issues for Level Designers, and adjusting VFX timing for artists. I also led setup for Enhanced Input and GAS templates to streamline ability integration across the team.",,,,,,,,,,
