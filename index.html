      <div class="about-text">
        <p>Hi, I'm Noah, a passionate game programmer and designer with a strong focus on technical design and gameplay systems.</p>
        <p>My journey into game development began back in middle school when I took a Java Minecraft modding course. That early experience ignited a love not just for playing games, but for creating them.</p>
        <p>I'm currently finishing my Masters of Science in Interactive Media on the Tech Design Track at the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy (FIEA), and I'm excited to bring my skills into professional projects.</p>
        <p>I love tackling technical challenges, refining player experiences, and bringing game mechanics to life. My background combines a strong foundation in programming with hands-on design experience across multiple genres and styles.</p>
        <p>Some of my favorite games include Terraria, Borderlands 2, Destiny, League of Legends, and Minecraft. More recently, I've been diving into games like Half-Life and Monster Hunter Wilds, which continue to inspire my creativity and passion for innovative game design.</p>
        <p>On this site, youâ€™ll find a collection of my work from solo projects to large team collaborations highlighting my growth as a technical designer.</p>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy exploring my projects!</p>
