      <div class="about-text">
        <p>I'm a Technical Designer driven by systems thinking, expressive combat, and the challenge of building scalable, player-focused gameplay. I work fluidly across design and engineering, prototyping mechanics in Unreal or Unity, building tools and abilities in C++/Blueprints or C#, and tuning for clarity, feel, and balance.</p>
        <p>My focus is on mechanics that scale. Whether that's a modular ability system, an AI framework that supports variety without bloat, or input systems that feel great across devices. I gravitate toward the intersection of design and technology, where great player experience comes from deeply integrated systems.</p>
        <p>I'm especially excited by games and tools that support mastery, emergent depth, and long-term engagement. Whether that means MMO combat tuning, competitive gameplay systems, or the engine-level tech that enables them. If you're building deep systems for passionate players, I'm in.</p>
